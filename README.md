My resume (linked to online LaTeX editor). 

There are a few versions, all written in LaTex:

* AlexLiuResume: the regular version of my resume, gives a concise rundown of my experience and projects with considerable depth
* AlexLiuCV: a longer version of my Resume (more like a curriculum vitae), contains everything I've done in the past
* AlexLiuResumeShort: a short version of my resume, only view for quick reference.
