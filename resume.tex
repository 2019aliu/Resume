% 		\resitem{\textbf{Research Abstract}: \footnotesize{Current research shows blocking the Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Receptor (CGRPR) most effectively treats migraines. First-principle calculations have been performed to analyze the interaction between one of the most effective migraines medicines and the active amino acids in the CGRPR. Based on the premise that two-dimensional (2D) materials have van der Waals interactions with amino acids, computations on the binding energies between the active amino acids in CGRPR and the selected 2D materials, silicene, germanene, and graphene oxide, have been performed. Based on the calculated binding energies, the interaction strength of each selected 2D material with CGRPR and that of olcegepant with CGRPR were compared. Results indicate that silicene possesses potentially potency to treat migraines more effectively yet economically than most existing treatments do.}}

Binding energies were evaluated for metal interaction with a first coordination sphere consisting of three nitrogens and one oxygen. Results indicate that this coordination sequence possesses greatest compatibility for copper. Due to copper's strongest affinity, binding energies were also evaluated for its interaction with MoS2, WS2, reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and cyanide. Our results indicate cyanide and rGO to possess strong chelation potential for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.}}
